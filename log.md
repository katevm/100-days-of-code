# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple map using plotly to visualize income equality in the United States at the county layer

**Thoughts** Need to do additional work to clean the data and look into a couple dozen counties that appear to be outliers. Also need to work on cleaning up and customizing the visualization.

### Day 2: June 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Explored different python libraries to interface with the U.S. Census Bureau's API. Primarily used CensusData to explore connections to the API

**Thoughts** This whole API thing is a bit confusing. I think once I get a handle on a library and learn the parameters things will start to make more sense.
