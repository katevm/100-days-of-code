# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Created simple map using plotly to visualize income equality in the United States at the county layer

**Thoughts** Need to do additional work to clean the data and look into a couple dozen counties that appear to be outliers. Also need to work on cleaning up and customizing the visualization.
